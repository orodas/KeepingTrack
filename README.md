# KeepingTrack

This Java project was originally designed to mimic a search history from a typical browser, but is now being expanded to funcion as a reminder list, or a planner as well. When executed, the user is given an interactive menu to decide what action to perform next. The current menu options are create an account, sign in, add to list, display list as is, display list in reverse order with filtered results, display the number of times each item in the list was present, display the most repeated item in the list, and exit. The list items are stored in a queue.
